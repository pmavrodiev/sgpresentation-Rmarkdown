* Summary
This is a custom pandoc beamer template for the SG presentation style.
Included is also a sample Rmarkdown presentation highlithing basic usage.

* Logic
Pandoc is basically a tool to convert files from one markup to another.
For more information refer to the [[http://pandoc.org/][official documentation]]

In our case the .Rmd file, which is in the RMarkdown format, is converted to a latex file by pandoc.
The latter is then compiled to a pdf via pdflatex.
Hence, the execution workflow is RMarkdown >> pandoc >> latex >> pdf

* Structure
- *test-presentation.Rmd* - the most important part of the presentation is its /YAML/ header (this is the header enclosed by --- lines in the very beginning of the file).
  The header gets processed by pandoc following the rules defined in SG_ETHclass.tex.
  It is trivial to add new header keywords, e.g. custom shading colors - just ensure that the corresponding logic to handle them exists in SG_ETHclass.tex

  For example the header keyword =title: My title= gets matched by the rule =if($title) \title{$title$}$endif$=.
  The end result is that the =\title= command will be written into the latex output with an argument corresponding to the supplied value in the .Rmd source.
  
- *SG_ETHclass.tex* contains the custom template.
  It reads the class definitions from the YAML header in the .Rmd source and translates them into appropriate latex commands.
  The template file can contain raw latex, which will simply be written as it is or pandoc rules that match the YAML header.

  Note that including keywords into the YAML header for which no rules exist in the template is ok (the keywords will simply be ignored).

  You can modify the template as you wish, either by adding more raw latex or by defining new rules.
  In general, it is a good practice to define rules for entitities that change with each presentation, e.g. title, author, etc., and to fix raw latex code otherwise.

- *notefilter.py* - This is a custom Python filter that enables /note/ and /column/ environments in RMarkdown.
  To insert a note page in your presentation, use the following markdown syntax:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [beginnote]
  The following list is part of a note page

    1. This is item one
    2. This is item two
       
  [endnote]
  #+END_QUOTE
  
* Installation
Put the custom template /SG_ETHclass.tex/ in a directory of your choice, preferrably in =/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/sg-ethbeamer/=.
Make sure to enter the full path to this template in the YAML header of /test-presentation.Rmd/.
The location of /test-presentation.Rmd/ itself is irrelevant.
